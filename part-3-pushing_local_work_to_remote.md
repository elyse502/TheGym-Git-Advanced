# Part 3: Advanced Workflows - Challenge 9: Pushing Local Work to Remote Repositories

## Steps to Push Local Changes to a Remote Repository

1. **Ensure Remote Repository Setup**
   - Confirm that you have a remote repository created on a Git hosting platform (e.g., GitHub).

2. **Check Current Branch**
   - Verify that you are on the branch you want to push:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

3. **Push Local Branch to Remote**
   - Use the following command to push your local branch to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```
   - Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of your local branch (e.g., `feature-branch`).

4. **Set Upstream Tracking (Optional)**
   - If this is the first time pushing the branch, set the upstream branch to simplify future pushes:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```

5. **Verify the Push**
   - Check your remote repository on the hosting platform to ensure your changes have been successfully pushed.

## Example Commands
```bash
git branch                       # Check current branch
git push origin feature-branch    # Push local branch to remote
# Optional: Set upstream tracking
git push -u origin feature-branch
```

By following these steps, you will successfully share your local changes with others by pushing them to the remote repository.
